# C-Projects-Piscine
 My work on Piscine 42

In July 2022 I started my journey on 42.
This Git repository was created to help all future pisciners on their journey to master C. Life wont be easy for you the "pisciner". You will have your fair share of fights against Moulinette and Norminette :) . But if you keep rising from your failures you are already that much closer in becoming a real 42 member. So here is some code that might help you with your piscine.
PS: For your own sake. Dont just ctrl+c & ctrl+v my code try to really understand it because on fridays you will be tested on it!

Cheers :)
